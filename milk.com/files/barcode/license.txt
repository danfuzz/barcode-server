Milk.com Barcode Server Source License
--------------------------------------

This license, issued by Dan Bornstein, entitles you to use the Milk.com
Barcode Server source code for any purpose whatsoever, except that you may
not resell the source code itself. You may, however, sell a product or
service which utilizes the source code, presumably in compiled form.

The source code in question may be found on the web via a link from the URL
<http://www.milk.com/barcode/>. It is available as both .zip and .tar.gz
archives.

While reasonable efforts have been made to assure that the source code is
bug-free, no guarantee is made that that is in fact the case. Updates to
the source code are made from time to time, and, within three years of
having entered into this license, you may, at your discretion, choose to
use the updated source code instead of the original code that you received.
After that time, a new license is required before you may use updated
source code, but you may continue to use the code you already have for as
long as you want.
