<h1>Barcode Server</h1>
<p><hr></p>

<p>Fill in the field below with a 7-, 8-, 12- or 13-digit number for a
barcode, y'know, like the ones you see on food, CDs, and books. If you want
to have the server generate a checksum for you, then just replace the last
digit with a question mark ("?"). By the way, those digits you sometimes
see to the left or the right of the barcodes are typically part of the
number encoded in the bars. And, please note, the barcodes that you can
generate here must consist only of digits (not letters or punctuation).</p>

<form action="server/barcode-request.cgi" method="post">
<table>
<tr>
  <td>Enter value to encode:</td>
  <td><input type="text" name="value" size=13 maxlength=13></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td><input type="submit" value="Show it"><br></td>
</tr>
</table>
</form>

<p>There are more options available on the <a href="server/">advanced
options page</a>. Joe-Bob says check it out.</p>

<h3>Read Me First!</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, the Barcode Server doesn't work as well as it used to.
This isn't because the server changed, but because the web changed around
it. The server produces what <i>used</i> to be the most widely recognized
image format on the web, called "XBM." However, none of the most recent
versions of any the major web browsers support this format anymore, for
reasons that elude me.</p>

<p>You can still save the image (which will look "broken" on your browser),
and there's a good chance you can double-click the result to see it,
but that's not the best solution in the world. At some point, I expect
I will finally get a chance to revamp the server, but I do have a day job
that takes up the vast majority of my computer-facing time, which means
I can't really make a firm commitment.</p>

<h3>Inspiration and History</h3>

<p>This toy was inspired by the October 2, 1994 edition of <a
href="http://www.beakman.com/"><cite>You Can With Beakman and
Jax</cite></a>, which featured <a
href="http://www.beakman.com/upc/barcode.html">an excellent description of
how UPC barcodes work</a>. Running near-continuously since that fateful
day in the fall of 1994, this was
the first barcode generating site on the web, and was also one of the first
public websites (if not <i>the</i> first such website) to serve
instantly-generated images. At first, the server only did the original
UPC-A form (the most common product barcode type in the USA), but in the
spring of 2001, improvements were made so that now the server can produce
pretty much any commonly-used UPC or EAN barcode.</p>

<h3>It's Not Begging, Really</h3>

<p>If you've found the Barcode Server site to be useful, then I'd appreciate
it if you gave me a token donation via PayPal
(<a href="https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=danfuzz%40milk.com&undefined_quantity=1&item_name=I+Am+A+Satisfied+Barcode+Server+User&amount=2.00&return=http%3A//www.milk.com/barcode/pay-thanks.html">$2</a>,

<h3>Official Barcode Numbers</h3>

<p>Sometimes people end up here because they're trying to find out how to
get a UPC code assigned for a product they wish to sell. In the USA,
at least, the <a href="http://www.uc-council.com/">Uniform Code Council</a>
does that. Once you have a number for your product, feel free to come
back here to look at the barcode associated with that number, and save
it, or print it, or what have you.</p>

<p>The previous paragraph isn't enough for some people.
<a href="use.html">This link provides a more detailed explanation.</a></p>

<p>If you're trying to encode the ISBN numbers that are found on books,
magazines, and other media, then <a href="isbn.html">the ISBN page may have
the information you require</a>.

<p>If you've tried to use a saved image and are having trouble, then
<a href="xbm.html">this page may be of help to you</a>.

<h3>The Devil's In The Details...<i>Not!</i></h3>

<p>One thing that people like to ask a lot is what the "meaning" is
of the little marks to the left and right and smack dab in the middle of
the code. On either side is a pair of thin dark bars separated by a thin
light bar, and in the middle, there's always the pattern
light-dark-light-dark-light. These are not in fact representations of a
digit, but are rather merely synchronization marks (sometimes called
"guard bars") that help
barcode-reading equipment recognize that it is in fact looking at a barcode
and help it determine the width of a mark (since barcodes come in different
sizes and the distance of the code from the equipment optics can affect the
readings as well). On the right-hand-side of a barcode (but not
on the left), the digit "6" is represented by something that <i>does</i>
bear a resemblence to the synch marks, and this has occasionally led
"antichrist hunters" to exclaim that all barcodes contain embedded within
them "the number of the beast" (that is, "666").</p>

      <table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0><tr>
        <td width=10 bgcolor=white align=center><font color=black size=1>0</font></td>
        <td width=10 bgcolor=black align=center><font color=white size=1>1</font></td>
        <td width=10 bgcolor=white align=center><font color=black size=1>0</font></td>
        <td width=10 bgcolor=black align=center><font color=white size=1>1</font></td>
        <td width=10 bgcolor=black align=center><font color=white size=1>1</font></td>
        <td width=10 bgcolor=black align=center><font color=white size=1>1</font></td>
        <td width=10 bgcolor=black align=center><font color=white size=1>1</font></td>
      </tr></table>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>That claim holds about as much water as saying the word "giggle" has the
mark of the beast because it looks like it has three
"6"s in it if you turn it upside down (if you draw your "g"s like
upside down "6"s).</p>

<table bgcolor="#d0d0d0" align=center border=1 cellpadding=5>
  <tr>
    <td align=center><img src="giggle.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>But just to re-fog things back up a bit: While the particular choice for
synch marks makes a lot of sense from an engineering standpoint, there's no
obvious reason that the particular representation for the digit "6" was
chosen, and it is conceivably possible &mdash; but arguably extremely
unlikely &mdash; that someone, some group of people,
or even some sinister force
(such as one of the devil's minions looking to get a big bonus that month)
influenced the standards process so as to make the representation for "6"
look as much like the synch marks as possible. But that doesn't change the
fact that the synch marks themselves are not in fact representations of
actual numerical quantities. Of course, if you care about this for anything
more than cocktail party conversation, you should consult with your
personal religious authority for the final word on the matter.</p>

<h3>Technical Information / Commercial Reuse / Linking</h3>

<p>For the technically inclined, you can check out the source code (<a
href="server/barcode-src.tar.gz"><code>.tar.gz</code></a> or <a
href="server/barcode-src.zip"><code>.zip</code></a> format), and you can
even use it if you want to, but you <em>must</em> abide by the terms given
in the header comment. In particular, you can only use it for free for
non-commercial purposes, and if you use the source code on your site, you
must give me credit and <a href="mailto:danfuzz@milk.com">mail me</a> to
let me know that you are using it (and give me a URL to check out!). If
your usage is inspired (there are several very uninspired duplicates or
even plagiaries of this site), I may decide to link to it from here.</p>

<p>Do not link to this site or to the embedded barcode generator CGI for
any commercial purpose whatsoever. This site is run in good faith as a free
resource for the technically curious and those in need of a quickie one-off
generated barcode, not as something to be taken advantage of on a regular
basis by commercial operations. For non-commercial purposes it is okay to
link to this page, but it is not okay to code a direct link to the embedded
barcode generator CGI. Please contact me if you are unclear about this.</p>

<p>I don't have the time or resources to offer free support for the code,
so please don't ask. However, I would be happy to sell you a very
reasonably-priced unlimited right to use (but not resell) the code for
commercial purposes. The code is very easy to use (but don't just take my
word for it; you can see for yourself by checking out the links two
paragraphs up), and by paying, you won't have to lie awake at night,
wracked with guilt about taking advantage of an honest programmer.</p>

<h3>Good &amp; Fun Non-Commercial Uses</h3>

<p>Someone finally did something fun with this code: <a
href="http://epistolary.org/rob/">Rob Carlson</a> is using it to <a
href="http://epistolary.org/rob/bonuscard/">reproduce grocery store "bonus"
cards</a> in an effort to undermine yet another corporation who wants to
know too much information about you.</p>

<p>This didn't use my code, but it's worth pointing at because it's really
nifty: <a href="http://www.barcodeart.com/art/art.html">Scott Blake's Bar
Code Art</a></p>

<h3>One Final Word</h3>

Enjoy!
