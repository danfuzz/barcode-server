  Fill in the "value" above with a 7-, 8-, 12- or 13-digit number for a
  barcode, y'know, like the ones you see on food, books, and other retail
  items. If you want to have the server generate a checksum for you, then just
  replace the last digit with a question mark ("?"). The "format" field lets you
  explicitly pick the barcode format, but if you leave it on "smart" it will
  generally pick something that will work. And if you want a supplemental code
  (often used to indicate the price of something), fill out the "supplement"
  field.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Please note:</b> The barcodes that you can generate here must
  consist only of digits (no letters or punctuation).

<h3>Inspiration and History</h3>

<p>
  This toy was inspired by the October 2, 1994 edition of <cite>You Can With
  Beakman and Jax</cite> (a newspaper comic), which featured an excellent
  description of how UPC barcodes work. Running near-continuously since that
  fateful day in the fall of 1994, this was the first barcode generating site on
  the web, and was also one of the first public websites (if not <i>the</i>
  first such website) to serve instantly-generated images. At first, the server
  only did the original UPC-A form (the most common product barcode type in the
  USA at the time), but in the spring of 2001, improvements were made such that
  the server could produce pretty much any commonly-used UPC or EAN barcode.
</p>

<p>
  Things took a turn for the worse sometime around 2010, when "XBM" (the image
  format produced by the server) stopped being supported by most web browsers.
  At that point, the server continued to work &mdash; sorta &mdash; except that
  it wasn't really easy to actually see what it was producing. Then, in 2023,
  the whole website was moved to a new system which didn't support "CGI" (the
  very basic web application framework that the Barcode Server used), and that
  totally broke it.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, again in 2023, the entire codebase of the server was revamped, such
  that it once again operates&hellip; and even better that it did in the first
  place! Instead of being a back-end server written in C and glued together with
  shell scripts, it is now a front-end browser application. So, perhaps
  technically it is no longer really a "server" so much as a fancy web page.
</p>

<h3>Official Barcode Numbers</h3>

<p>
  Sometimes people end up here because they're trying to find out how to
  get a UPC code assigned for a product they wish to sell. In the USA,
  at least, the Uniform Code Council does that. Once you have a number for your
  product, feel free to come back here to look at the barcode associated with
  that number, and save it, or print it, or what have you.
</p>

<p>
  The previous paragraph isn't enough for some people. Here is
  <a href="use.html">a more detailed explanation</a>.
</p>

<h3>The Devil's In The Details...<i>Not!</i></h3>

<p>
  One thing that people like to ask a lot is what the "meaning" is
  of the little marks to the left and right and smack dab in the middle of
  the code. On either side is a pair of thin dark bars separated by a thin
  light bar, and in the middle, there's always the pattern
  light-dark-light-dark-light. These are not in fact representations of a
  digit, but are rather merely synchronization marks (sometimes called
  "guard bars") that help
  barcode-reading equipment recognize that it is in fact looking at a barcode
  and help it determine the width of a mark (since barcodes come in different
  sizes and the distance of the code from the equipment optics can affect the
  readings as well). On the right-hand-side of a barcode (but not
  on the left), the digit "6" is represented by something that <i>does</i>
  bear a resemblence to the synch marks, and this has occasionally led
  "antichrist hunters" to exclaim that all barcodes contain embedded within
  them "the number of the beast" (that is, "666").

<p>
  That claim holds about as much water as saying the word "giggle" has the
  mark of the beast because it looks like it has three
  "6"s in it if you turn it upside down (if you draw your "g"s like
  upside down "6"s).
</p>

<table class="giggle">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="giggle.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  But just to re-fog things back up a bit: While the particular choice for
  synch marks makes a lot of sense from an engineering standpoint, there's no
  obvious reason that the particular representation for the digit "6" was
  chosen, and it is conceivably possible &mdash; but arguably extremely
  unlikely &mdash; that someone, some group of people,
  or even some sinister force
  (such as one of the devil's minions looking to get a big bonus that month)
  influenced the standards process so as to make the representation for "6"
  look as much like the synch marks as possible. But that doesn't change the
  fact that the synch marks themselves are not in fact representations of
  actual numerical quantities. Of course, if you care about this for anything
  more than cocktail party conversation, you should consult with your
  personal religious authority for the final word on the matter.
