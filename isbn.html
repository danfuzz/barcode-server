<h1>Barcode Server: ISBNs (Media Identification Numbers)</h1>

<p>
  Standard UPC/EAN barcodes, such as the ones that this site can produce,
  are commonly used to encode ISBNs, that is, the identification numbers that
  are associated with books, magazines, CDs, DVDs, and other media.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to encode an ISBN, it's pretty simple:
</p>

<p>
  Start with the 10 digit ISBN, and drop the last digit (or the "X" which
  sometimes appears in place of a digit). This leaves you with nine digits. Add
  "978" to the beginning of the number. Now you have a 12-digit number. The
  final barcode will have 13 digits, the last digit being a "checksum" that the
  Barcode Server will calculate for you if you put a question mark ("?") there.
  So, enter the 12 digits &mdash; just the digits, no hyphens or anything else
  &mdash; followed by the question mark, and you should get the proper barcode.
</p>

<p>
  For example, I am looking at Nolo Press's <i>Fight Your Ticket&hellip;and
  Win!</i>, which has ISBN "0-87337-294-8". The nine useful digits are
  "087337294". Adding "978" to the beginning, it becomes "978087337294".
  Adding a question mark to the end, I get "978087337294?", which I type into
  the Barcode Server input field, and out pops the barcode for that book.
</p>

<p>
  Note that often books come with a five digit supplemental barcode off to
  the right of the main one (which often represents the retail price of the
  book). You can encode that with the Barcode Server too.
