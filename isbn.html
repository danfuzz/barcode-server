<h1>Barcode Server: ISBNs (Media Identification Numbers)</h1>

<p>
  Standard UPC/EAN barcodes, such as the ones that this site can produce,
  are commonly used to encode ISBNs, that is, the identification numbers that
  are associated with books, magazines, CDs, DVDs, and other media.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to encode an ISBN, the "smart" format selector on the main page
  will generally work, and you can also explicitly select "EAN-13 / ISBN."
</p>

<p>
  <b>If your ISBN number starts with the digits "978" and has thirteen
  digits,</b> then that's a "modern" ISBN number, and the Barcode Server will
  handle it directly.
</p>

<p>
  <b>If your ISBN number does not start with "978" and has ten digits,</b> then
  that's an "old-style" number, in which case here's how you convert it:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Start with the ten-digit ISBN number. Don't include any dashes or other
    punctuation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove the final digit (or the "X" which sometimes appears in place of a
    digit). This leaves you with nine digits.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add "978" to the beginnging of the number. Now you have a twelve-digit
    number.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add "?" (a question mark) to the end for the thirteenth digit. This tells
    the Barcode Server to calculate that digit (the checksum) for you.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you ask the server to show you the result, that should be the proper ISBN
  barcode.
</p>

<p>
  For example, I am looking at Nolo Press's <i>Fight Your Ticket&hellip;and
  Win!</i>, which has ISBN "0-87337-294-8". The nine useful digits are
  "087337294". Adding "978" to the beginning, it becomes "978087337294".
  Adding a question mark to the end, I get "978087337294?", which I type into
  the Barcode Server input field, and out pops the barcode for that book.
</p>

<h3>Supplemental codes</h3>

<p>
  Note that often books come with a five digit supplemental barcode off to
  the right of the main one (which often represents the retail price of the
  book). You can encode that with the Barcode Server too.
